# Plain
Welcome to the Plain project!

Plain is an educational project to learn more about how webbrowsers work.
Everyone has used webbrowsers, yet only a small number of people *really* know how they work.

Multiple decades worth of research have gone into the likes of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Mozilla FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), or [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge).

There's absolutely no way for me to even come to close to the scale and efficiency of those projects. I simply want to write a webbrowser that can render HTML pages. Perhaps even some basic styling with CSS, but nothing too fancy. I think that this is a realistic, albeit ambitous, goal.
