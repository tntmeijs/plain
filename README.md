# Plain
Welcome to the Plain project!

Plain is an educational project to learn more about how webbrowsers work.
Everyone has used webbrowsers, yet only a small number of people *really* know how they work.

Multiple decades worth of research have gone into the likes of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Mozilla FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), or [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge).
Plain will realistically never even come close to the commercial webbrowsers.

However, you will be able to navigate the web using Plain!

# Third-party libraries
Writing a webbrowser from scratch is a lot of work.
To avoid spending a lot of time writing literally *everything* from scratch, Plain uses a few open-source, third-party, dependencies.
- [Spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) ([MIT](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/blob/v1.x/LICENSE)): Very fast, header-only/compiled, C++ logging library.

This project would not have been possible without the help of these awesome libraries. â™¥
